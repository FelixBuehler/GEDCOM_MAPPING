# GEDCOM_MAPPING
Visualization tool to map and animate the displacements of ancestors.

To use this and make the result interesting, you must have gathered some genealogical data in a gedcom file.

Run the scripts in this order:

1. displacement_finder
2. creation_map
3. make_video

The code will not be pretty or optimized, I am an amateur.

Let me know if you use my tool and, if you do sucessfully, show me your animation!
